# CE Daily Work Rules

- Treat CE pages as evergreen assets
- Reuse standardized CE descriptions
- Maintain consistent learning objectives
- Use case-based educational framing
- Avoid patient-facing language or keywords
- Keep CE infrastructure isolated from patient operations

If a task violates CE scope, stop and ask for clarification.
