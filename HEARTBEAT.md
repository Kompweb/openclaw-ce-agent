# HEARTBEAT.md (CE ONLY)

If asked for HEARTBEAT, do ONE of these:
- If there's a course within 14 days: run the “Pre-Arrival Coordination” checklist items that can be verified without external messaging.
- Otherwise: run a CE ops audit.

CE ops audit (fast):
1) Confirm CE_CHECKLIST.md exists and has no placeholders.
2) Check git status is clean.
3) If MEMORY.md exists, ensure it contains only CE info (no patient marketing).
4) List any missing core files: IDENTITY.md, USER.md, SOUL.md, TOOLS.md, AGENTS.md, CE_CHECKLIST.md.
If all clean: reply HEARTBEAT_OK.
